      " <think>\n",
      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this question about calculating probabilities related to the distressed credit criteria using Bayes' formula. Hmm, I remember Bayes' theorem from my studies, but I should probably take it step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the problem gives some information:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 40% of companies go bankrupt within a year (P(non-survivor) = 0.40).\n",
      "- 55% pass the test (P(pass test) = 0.55).\n",
      "- The probability that a company will pass given it survives is 85% (P(pass test | survivor) = 0.85).\n",
      "\n",
      "The questions are A, B, C, and D.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with question A: What's P(pass test | non-survivor)? So this is the probability of passing the test given that the company doesn't survive. I don't have direct information for this. Maybe it can be derived from other probabilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that the total probability of passing is 0.55, which includes both survivors and non-surpliers. Let me define some variables to clarify.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let S = Survive (survivor), not S = doesn't survive (non-survivor).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given:\n",
      "P(S) = 0.60 (since 40% go bankrupt, so 60% survive)\n",
      "P(not S) = 0.40\n",
      "P(pass test | S) = 0.85\n",
      "P(pass test) = 0.55\n",
      "\n",
      "We need P(pass test | not S). Let's denote this as P(Pass | Non).\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the law of total probability, P(pass test) = P(pass test | S)*P(S) + P(pass test | non-S)*P(non-S)\n",
      "\n",
      "Plugging in numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "0.55 = 0.85*0.60 + P(Pass | non-S)*0.40\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating 0.85*0.60: that's 0.51.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 0.55 = 0.51 + (P_pass_non_S * 0.40)\n",
      "\n",
      "Subtracting 0.51 from both sides: 0.04 = 0.40 * P_pass_non_S\n",
      "\n",
      "Divide both sides by 0.40: P_pass_non_S = 0.04 / 0.40 = 0.10.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, A is 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to B: What's P(Survivor | pass test)? This requires Bayes' theorem. The formula is:\n",
      "\n",
      "P(S | Pass) = [P(Pass | S) * P(S)] / P(Pass)\n",
      "\n",
      "We have:\n",
      "P(Pass | S) = 0.85\n",
      "P(S) = 0.60\n",
      "P(Pass) = 0.55\n",
      "\n",
      "So plug in the numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "P(S | Pass) = (0.85 * 0.60) / 0.55\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating numerator: 0.85*0.60 = 0.51\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 0.51 / 0.55 ≈ 0.9273 or approximately 92.73%.\n",
      "\n",
      "So B is about 92.73%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, question C: What's P(non-survivor | fail test)? That's the probability of non-surviving given failing the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, using Bayes' theorem here as well. But we can think in terms of not surviving and failing.\n",
      "\n",
      "P(Fail Test | Non-S) would be the same as 1 - P(Pass Test | Non-S), which we calculated earlier as 0.90.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, using Bayes:\n",
      "\n",
      "P(Non-S | Fail Test) = [P(Fail Test | Non-S)*P(Non-S)] / P(Fail Test)\n",
      "\n",
      "We know:\n",
      "P(Fail Test) = 1 - P(Pass Test) = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming we don't have direct P(Fail Test | Non-S), but from the calculation above, since P(Pass Test | Non-S) is 0.90 (so failing would be 0.10).\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me confirm:\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I use Bayes with:\n",
      "\n",
      "P(Non-S | Fail Test) = [P(Fail Test | Non-S)*P(Non-S)] / P(Fail Test)\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to find P(Fail Test). We can compute it as:\n",
      "\n",
      "P(Fail Test | S)*P(S) + P(Fail Test | non-S)*P(non-S)\n",
      "\n",
      "From previous calculations, we have that P(Pass Test | non-S) = 0.90, so failing would be 1 - 0.90 = 0.10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus,\n",
      "\n",
      "P(Fail Test) = (0.85*0.60) + (0.10*0.40) = 0.51 + 0.04 = 0.55, which checks out since the total P(Pass Test) is given as 0.55.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, computing P(Non-S | Fail Test):\n",
      "\n",
      "P(Non-S | Fail Test) = [0.10 * 0.40] / 0.55\n",
      "\n",
      "Calculating numerator: 0.10*0.40 = 0.04\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, 0.04 / 0.55 ≈ 0.0727 or about 7.27%.\n",
      "\n",
      "So C is approximately 7.27%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, question D: Is the test effective?\n",
      "\n",
      "An effective test would have a high probability of correctly classifying the companies into survivors and non-survivors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at B, which is ~92.73%, it's quite high. So passing the test significantly reduces the probability of being a survivor to about 7.27% of those who failed. That seems like a strong indicator that the test works well in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors. Therefore, I would say yes, the test is effective.\n",
